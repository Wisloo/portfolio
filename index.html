    <div class="about-content">
        <p>I'm Louis, a 2nd-year Computer Science student who is into coding! I'm currently diving deep into the world of web development and building cool projects that solve real problems.</p>
        <p>What gets me excited? Doing websites, applications, and putting theory into practice. I am knowledgeable in C++, Java, C#, and always curious about learning new technologies.</p>
        <p>Beyond programming, I'm passionate about Cycling and Music. I believe that great technology should not only work well but also make people's lives better.</p>
